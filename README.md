# CINF401-projects
A copy of the most interesting projects I did in Dr. Eckroth's Spring 2017 Big Data course.

I was the sole author of Assignment 5 and Project 1. While Projects 2, 3, and 4 were completed with
a partner, there is no component of the final product on any of them in which I was not involved.

The source code does not always reflect the complete extent of the data processing that we did, 
though when shell scripts were used they are included. The parallel processing was performed in
the specific environment provided by the course instructor.
